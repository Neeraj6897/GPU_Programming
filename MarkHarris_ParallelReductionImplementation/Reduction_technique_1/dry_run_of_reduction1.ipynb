    "Let's dry run the provided CUDA kernel `reduce0` with the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Total Numbers:** 16 (in `g_idata`)\n",
    "* **Block Size (`blockDim.x`):** 4\n",
    "* **Number of Blocks (`gridDim.x`):** 5\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:** With 16 total numbers and a block size of 4, we would ideally need `16 / 4 = 4` blocks to process all the input elements. However, the example specifies 5 blocks. This means the last block will have some threads accessing out-of-bounds elements of `g_idata`. We'll observe how the code handles this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `g_idata` on the device initially contains the numbers: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]`\n",
    "* `g_odata` on the device is initialized to some arbitrary values (which will be overwritten).\n",
    "* The kernel is launched with the configuration `reduce0<<<5, 4, 4 * sizeof(int)>>>`. The `4 * sizeof(int)` specifies the shared memory size for each block, which is enough to hold `blockDim.x` (4) integers.\n",

    "* Each block (except the last one) correctly calculates the sum of 4 consecutive elements from `g_idata` using a tree-based reduction in shared memory.\n",
    "* The `extern __shared__ int sdata[];` declaration allows the kernel to use a shared memory region whose size is determined at kernel launch.\n",
    "* The `__syncthreads()` calls are crucial to ensure that all threads in a block have loaded their data into shared memory before the reduction starts and that each reduction step is completed by all participating threads before the next step begins.\n",
    "* The example highlights a common pitfall: when the number of blocks doesn't perfectly align with the total number of elements and the block size, some threads in the later blocks might access memory outside the intended bounds, leading to undefined behavior. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle such cases carefully (e.g., by adding boundary checks within the kernel)."
