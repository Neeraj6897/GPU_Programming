Here’s a concise breakdown of **why the strided (sequential) loop outperforms the original divergent loop**, focusing on **warp execution**, **branch divergence**, and **memory access**.  

## Summary  
The original “divergent” reduction loop uses a modulus-based `if` predicate (`tid % (2*s) == 0`), which causes threads within a warp to follow different execution paths, leading to serialization and underutilized schedulers citeturn1search0. The strided version replaces that with a uniform check (`index < blockDim.x`) and computes a contiguous shared‑memory stride (`index = 2*s*tid`), eliminating divergence and achieving bank‑conflict‑free access in shared memory citeturn0search4turn0search5. As a result, all threads in a warp remain active, maximizing instruction throughput and shared‑memory bandwidth, which is critical for a memory‑bound operation like reduction citeturn0search1turn0search8.

## 1. Branch Divergence vs. Uniform Predicate  

- **Divergent Loop:**  
  ```cpp
  if (tid % (2*s) == 0) { … }
  ```  
  Different threads in the same warp evaluate `tid % (2*s) == 0` differently; some threads execute the add, others idle. This forces the warp scheduler to serialize the two paths, causing idle cycles (“stall‑wait”) and underutilization of the SM’s pipelines citeturn1search0.  

- **Strided Loop:**  
  ```cpp
  if (index < blockDim.x) { … }
  ```  
  All threads compute `index` the same way and then test a single boundary condition. Within a warp, they all either pass or fail the test together—there’s no left‑behind subset of threads. This **eliminates warp divergence** and keeps all lanes busy for each instruction cycle citeturn1search2.

## 2. Memory Access Patterns and Bank Conflicts  

- **Interleaved (Divergent) Access:**  
  Using `sdata[tid + s]` after a modulus check often leads to **non‑contiguous** access patterns across threads. In older GPUs, this can cause shared‑memory bank conflicts, where multiple threads hit the same memory bank and serialize their accesses citeturn0search4.  

- **Sequential (Strided) Access:**  
  By computing `index = 2*s*tid`, adjacent threads access `sdata[index]` in perfect stride: thread 0 accesses 0, thread 1 accesses 2*s, thread 2 accesses 4*s, and so on. This pattern **aligns each thread’s access with distinct memory banks**, avoiding conflicts entirely citeturn0search4. Since shared memory has **low latency** and **no penalty for non‑contiguous** accesses across banks, this layout maximizes throughput citeturn0search5.

## 3. Impact on Warp and SM Utilization  

- **Warp Underutilization in Divergent Case:**  
  When only half—or some fraction—of the threads in a warp do work, the scheduler issues instructions fewer times per cycle (e.g., 1 instruction per ~4.8 cycles instead of 1 per cycle) because inactive lanes stall the warp citeturn1search0.  

- **Full Warp Efficiency in Strided Case:**  
  With no divergence, all 32 threads in a warp execute each addition in lockstep. The SM can issue an instruction every cycle, keeping **“Active Warps Per Scheduler”** at its maximum and minimizing **stall‑wait** time citeturn1search0.

## 4. Overall Performance Benefit  

- **Divergent Kernel Performance:**  
  In benchmarks on a 4 M‑element reduction, the “interleaved addressing with divergent branching” version achieved ~2.083 GB/s bandwidth and took ~8.054 ms citeturn0search4.  

- **Strided Kernel Performance:**  
  The “sequential addressing” strided version doubled the bandwidth (~4.854 GB/s) and cut runtime by more than half (~3.456 ms), a **2.33× speedup** over the divergent version citeturn0search4turn0search8.

## 5. Why It Matters for Reduction  

Parallel reduction is **memory‑bound** (only ~1 flop per element) and aims for **peak bandwidth** citeturn0search1turn0search9. Eliminating warp divergence and bank conflicts lets your code fully utilize the GPU’s shared‑memory bandwidth, achieving performance closer to the hardware’s limits.

### Key Takeaways  
1. **Remove Modulus‑Based Predicates:** Avoid `tid % (2*s)` checks inside warps.  
2. **Use Strided Indexing:** Compute `index = 2*s*tid` so threads map to unique, contiguous banks.  
3. **Uniform Branching:** Test a single boundary condition (`index < blockDim.x`) to keep warps coherent.  

Following these steps transforms your reduction from a performance‑crippled, divergent kernel into a high‑throughput, shared‑memory‑optimized loop that makes the most of your GPU’s capabilities.
